## 🚀 Overview

**Uppend** is a blockchain-based platform developed during **MADhackathon 2025**, designed to enable energy suppliers and buyers to **create, sign, and manage supply contracts** securely and transparently.  
Built on **Qubic’s decentralized DAG network**, Uppend ensures formalized agreements, traceable interactions, and a user-friendly experience for contract management.

## ⚙️ Project Status (Hackathon Scope)

- ✅ **Smart contract**: Custom contract developed and successfully deployed to the Qubic DAG node.
- ✅ **Frontend UI**: Developed based on the official hackathon demo; responsive and functional.
- ⚠️ **Integration**: Connection between the frontend and smart contract is **partially implemented**.  
  Due to a **fetch-related issue**, full interaction between UI and blockchain is **pending resolution**.
- 🚧 This repository reflects a **fully working backend and contract layer**, with the interface **partially connected** — further development is planned post-hackathon.

> 💡 Despite time constraints, the core system and logic were implemented and demonstrated during the event. Our focus was delivering a viable MVP with real blockchain functionality.
